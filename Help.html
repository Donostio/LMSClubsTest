    <h1>Guide to the Lady Margaret School Clubs Tool</h1>
    
    <p>üëã We're lucky to have so many free clubs available at LMS! It can be tricky to navigate them all, so the PTA and class reps have put together this quick guide to help you use the LMS Clubs tool. It's designed to make finding clubs and printing a timetable of your available and chosen ones super easy!</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Filter by Year Group</h2>
    <p>The first and most important step is to **select your year group**. You'll see a dropdown menu right at the top of the page. Once you choose your year, the page will automatically refresh to show only the clubs available. This is key, as it enables the rest of the site's features, including the ability to select and print clubs.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 2: Explore and Filter Clubs</h2>
    <p>Now that you've narrowed it down, you can start exploring!</p>
    
    <h3>Search Bar</h3>
    <p>Looking for a specific club? Just start typing the club name into the search bar.</p>
    
    <h3>Filter Panel</h3>
    <p>For more detailed searching, click the purple "Filters" button on the top right. This opens a panel with a few great options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>**Day**: Find clubs that run on a specific day of the week, like "Monday" or "Friday".</li>
      <li>**When**: Filter by "Lunchtime," "After School," or "Before School" to fit your schedule.</li>
      <li>**Department**: Want to see only sports clubs or music clubs? Use the "Department" dropdown to filter by categories like "Music" or "PE."</li>
      <li>**Club Name**: You can also scroll through a list to see all the club names at a glance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step 3: Select & Print Your Timetable üñ®Ô∏è</h2>
    <p>Once you've filtered the list and found a few clubs you‚Äôre interested in, you can highlight them for easy reference.</p>
    
    <h3>Make a Selection</h3>
    <p>See the club cards small checkbox in the bottom-right corner? Check this box to add the club to your personal selection.</p>
    
    <h3>Print Timetable</h3>
    <p>After selecting a year group, a new button will appear on the page: "Print My Timetable." Click this button to generate a clean, easy-to-read PDF or send to your printer. This timetable will include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All the clubs available to your year group.</li>
      <li>The clubs you selected will be clearly **highlighted** with extra details like the **location** and the **staff member** in charge.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This way, you get a full picture of all the options while also having a handy list of the clubs you're interested in.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <h3>A Few Extra Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>**Duplicate Clubs**: The site will alert you if you select more than one club that takes place at the same time on the same day. This helps avoid scheduling conflicts! It will still appear in your timetable if you keep it selected.</li>
        <li>**Deselect All**: If you want to start over, use the "Deselect All Clubs" button.</li>
        <li>**No Results?**: If your filters are too specific and you don't see any clubs, you can click "Clear All Filters" at the bottom of the filter panel to reset and start again.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p>We hope this makes the club selection process a little smoother!</p>
