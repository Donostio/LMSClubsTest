  <h1>Guide to the Lady Margaret School Clubs Tool</h1>

  <p>ðŸ‘‹ We're lucky to have so many free clubs available at LMS! It can be tricky to navigate them all, so the PTA and class reps have put together this quick guide to help you use the LMS Clubs tool. It's designed to make finding clubs and printing a timetable of your available and chosen ones super easy!</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Step 1: Filter by Year Group</h2>
  <p>The first and most important step is to <strong>select your year group</strong>. You'll see a dropdown menu right at the top of the page. Once you choose your year, the page will automatically refresh to show only the clubs available. This is key, as it enables the rest of the site's features, including the ability to select and print clubs.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Step 2: Explore and Filter Clubs</h2>
  <p>Now that you've narrowed it down, you can start exploring!</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Search Bar:</strong> Looking for a specific club? Just start typing the club name into the search bar.</li>
    <li><strong>Filter Panel:</strong> For more detailed searching, click the purple "Filters" button on the top right. This opens a panel with a few great options:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Day:</strong> Find clubs that run on a specific day of the week, like "Monday" or "Friday".</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> Filter by "Lunchtime," "After School," or "Before School" to fit your schedule.</li>
        <li><strong>Department:</strong> Want to see only sports clubs or music clubs? Use the "Department" dropdown to filter by categories like "Music" or "PE."</li>
        <li><strong>Club Name:</strong> You can also scroll through a list to see all the club names at a glance.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
